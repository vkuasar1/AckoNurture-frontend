When the user taps “Already registered?”, we do not take them to a separate flow. Instead:

Step 1 – Popup: Scan or Enter Code

Show a centered modal / bottom sheet with:

Title: “Connect your hospital registration”

Subtitle: “Scan the QR on your hospital sheet or enter your code.”

Two big options:

Button with icon: “Scan QR”

Text field with label: “Enter registration code” and a button: “Continue”

Small helper text: “This lets us pre-fill your baby and mother details from the hospital.”

You can assume dummy values for now; this is a design/UX flow, not real integration.

Step 2 – Success State

After scan / code:

Show a small success screen or inline success state:

Icon (checkmark)

Text: “We’ve fetched your details from the hospital.”

Subtext: “You can edit them in the next steps.”

Button: “Continue”

Step 3 – Prefilled Onboarding (same as ‘Start your journey’)

Now reuse the same onboarding flow as the Start your journey CTA, but with fields prefilled:

Screen A – Baby Basics

Fields: Baby name, DOB, gender

These should already be filled from hospital data but editable.

Label hint: “Pulled from your hospital registration – edit if needed.”

Screen B – Mother Basics

Fields: Mother’s name, delivery type (normal / C-sec), feeding method (if known)

Again, prefilled where possible, but editable.

Screen C – What Do You Need Help With?

Multi-select chips: Vaccination, Growth tracking, Milestones, Sleep support, Feeding help, Return-to-work, Nanny support.

Screen D – Location (optional)

City / pincode to help with nanny matching.

Screen E – Account creation

Phone / Google / Apple sign-in.

Visually, these screens should look identical to the normal “Start your journey” onboarding, just with:

Pre-filled values

A small “from your hospital registration” helper line at the top of the first 1–2 screens.

Visual Style:

Same soft pastel gradient and friendly rounded shapes as the main landing screen.

Use a hospital-trust cue (small “Verified by your hospital” tag inside the modal or on the first prefilled screen).

Keep everything simple, large tap targets, minimal text.

Overall tone:
Fast, low-effort, hospital-trusted, and clearly leading into the standard onboarding flow with prefilled values.
