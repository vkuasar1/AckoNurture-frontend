Title: Milestones

At the top, show a reassuring intro block:

“Every baby grows at their own pace.”
“Here are some skills that many babies around this age may start showing. Use this list to notice and celebrate what your baby does, not to compare or judge.”

Below this, show age chips or tabs:

0–3 months

3–6 months

6–9 months

etc.
(0–3 months can be fully designed as the main example.)

📋 Milestones List (for an age range)

For the selected age range (e.g., 0–3 months), show a list of milestones.

Each milestone row contains:

Milestone title (e.g., “Smiles back at you”)

Optional short description (e.g., “Responds to your face and voice with social smiles.”)

Status selector with 3 gentle options:

✅ “Yes, I’ve noticed this”

🌱 “Not yet / not sure”

✨ “Emerging (sometimes)” (optional third state)

Visually:

When marked “Yes, I’ve noticed this”, show a gentle green check and maybe a small celebration icon (tiny star), but keep it subtle and not “gamified ranking”.

When marked “Not yet / not sure”, do not show any red or warning. Keep it neutral.

📊 Progress Summary (Non-judgmental)

At the top or bottom, show a soft progress summary:

“You’ve noticed X of Y common skills for this age.”

Neutral progress bar, no red zone.

Below the progress bar, add a fixed reassuring message, for example:

“It’s okay if you haven’t seen everything on this list yet. Babies develop at different speeds, and that’s completely normal.”

🧠 Smart, But Gentle “Missing” Handling

If the parent has marked many items as “Not yet / not sure” or left most items unmarked by the upper bound of that age range, the system can show a calm, informative note, never a warning.

Example:

“You’ve marked a few skills as ‘not yet’ or haven’t had a chance to observe them.
This doesn’t mean something is wrong — many babies take their own time.
If you’re feeling worried or unsure, it can help to talk to your pediatrician for reassurance.”

Key points:

No red labels.

No “delay” or “late” wording.

This note appears as information + reassurance, not as an alert.

🩺 “Talk to a doctor” Entry (By Parent Choice)

At the bottom of the screen, add a small, gentle CTA:

Text button: “Talk to a doctor if you feel concerned”

This can open:

A teleconsult option, or

A simple “how to prepare for a developmental check-up” info sheet.

Again, the wording: “if you feel concerned”, not “you should be concerned”.

🎉 Celebratory Tone When Logging Milestones

When a parent marks a milestone as “Yes, I’ve noticed this”:

Show a tiny micro-feedback (e.g., a small check + “That’s lovely to see!”).

Optional small toast:

“Logged as a new milestone for {Baby Name}.”

But do not rank, score, or create FOMO. It’s about recording & celebrating, not competing.

😌 Empty State (Early Use)

If they haven’t logged anything yet in a given age range, show:

“As your baby grows, you’ll start noticing new little skills and behaviours.
Use this list to gently keep track of them over time. There’s no rush — every baby has their own pace.”

🔁 Data Interaction With Other Parts (Optional)

When a milestone is marked “Yes”, it also appears in Medical Records Timeline as a “Milestone logged” entry (e.g., “Aria started smiling socially.”).

But this is for celebration / journaling, not diagnosis.

📌 Design Constraints

All visuals must remain soft, pastel, non-threatening.

No red icons, exclamation marks, sirens, or alarming copy.

The primary design goals:

Reduce parental anxiety

Encourage observation & celebration

Normalize developmental variation

Offer doctor as a safe option if parents already feel worried
